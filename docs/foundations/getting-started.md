# STEM Foundations Learning Path

## A Supplementary Resource for Research Engineers

This foundations path is a **supplementary resource** designed to support your journey through the [Research Engineering Learning Path](../research-engineering/getting-started.md). When you encounter mathematical concepts, scientific principles, or programming techniques you need to understand better, come here for structured learning resources.

:::info This is a Reference Library
**You don't need to complete this before starting research!** The [Research Engineering Learning Path](../research-engineering/getting-started.md) is your main guide. Use these foundations for just-in-time learning when you need to refresh or learn specific concepts.
:::

## Philosophy: Just-in-Time Learning

### What is Just-in-Time Learning?

Rather than spending years studying prerequisites, we believe in:
- **Learning what you need, when you need it**
- **Building foundations as you encounter them in research**
- **Self-awareness about your knowledge gaps**
- **Targeted study for specific research goals**

### How to Use This Path

1. **Start with self-assessment** - Be honest about what you know
2. **Identify gaps as they arise** - Notice when you're stuck
3. **Study targeted topics** - Focus on what's blocking you
4. **Apply immediately** - Use new knowledge in your research
5. **Iterate and grow** - Build deeper understanding over time

## Self-Assessment Guide

### Ask Yourself These Questions

Before diving into foundations, reflect on your current knowledge:

#### Mathematics
- Can I solve basic algebra problems?
- Do I understand functions and graphs?
- Am I comfortable with derivatives and integrals?
- Can I work with matrices and vectors?
- Do I understand probability and statistics?

#### Science
- Do I understand the scientific method?
- Can I design a controlled experiment?
- Am I familiar with basic physics concepts?
- Do I understand chemical reactions and bonds?
- Can I explain biological systems?

#### Computing
- Can I write basic programs?
- Do I understand algorithms and data structures?
- Am I comfortable with computational thinking?
- Can I analyze algorithm complexity?
- Do I understand computer architecture?

### Finding Your Starting Point

Based on your self-assessment:

- **Complete beginner**: Start with [Stage 0: Early Foundations](stage-0-early.md)
- **Some high school**: Begin at [Stage 2: Middle School](stage-2-middle.md)
- **High school graduate**: Try [Stage 3: Secondary](stage-3-secondary.md)
- **Some college**: Jump to [Stage 4: College Core](stage-4-college-core.md)
- **College graduate**: Review [Stage 5: Expansion](stage-5-expansion.md) for gaps
- **Just need specifics**: Use the search or browse by topic

## The Learning Stages

Our curriculum is organized into 7 progressive stages:

### [Stage 0: Early Foundations (Pre-K to Grade 2)](stage-0-early.md)
Building blocks of mathematical thinking and scientific observation

### [Stage 1: Primary Foundations (Grades 3-5)](stage-1-primary.md)
Core arithmetic, basic science, and introduction to logical thinking

### [Stage 2: Middle School Foundations (Grades 6-8)](stage-2-middle.md)
Pre-algebra, earth science, life science, and computational thinking

### [Stage 3: Secondary Foundations (Grades 9-12)](stage-3-secondary.md)
Algebra through pre-calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, and programming

### [Stage 4: College Core (Years 1-2)](stage-4-college-core.md)
Calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and intermediate programming

### [Stage 5: Expansion (Years 2-3)](stage-5-expansion.md)
Advanced mathematics, specialized sciences, and advanced computing

### [Stage 6: Advanced Topics (Years 3-4)](stage-6-advanced.md)
Graduate-level preparation in mathematics, science, and computing

## Connection to Research Engineering

### Start Research Engineering Now!

**You don't need to wait!** Begin the [Research Engineering Learning Path](../research-engineering/getting-started.md) immediately. You can start research with:

- **Curiosity and willingness to learn** (That's all!)
- **Basic computer literacy** (Can use a computer and internet)
- **Reading comprehension** (Can follow instructions)

As you progress through research engineering, return here when you need to strengthen specific foundations. Most people need:

- **Basic programming ability** (Stage 2-3) - Learn as you implement
- **Understanding of the scientific method** (Stage 1-2) - Learn by doing research
- **Comfort with basic statistics** (Stage 3-4) - Learn when analyzing data
- **Self-directed learning skills** (Any stage) - Develop through practice

### How Foundations Support Research

Each research step benefits from specific foundations:

1. **Literature Review**: Reading comprehension, domain knowledge
2. **Problem Identification**: Critical thinking, pattern recognition
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Scientific method, logical reasoning
4. **Experimental Design**: Statistics, controlled variables
5. **Implementation**: Programming, mathematics
6. **Data Analysis**: Statistics, visualization
7. **Validation**: Statistical testing, error analysis
