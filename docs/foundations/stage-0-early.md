## Assessment & Progress

### Ready for Stage 1?
You're ready to move on when you can:
- ✓ Count to 100 confidently
- ✓ Add and subtract within 20
- ✓ Recognize and continue patterns
- ✓ Read simple sentences
- ✓ Make and record observations
- ✓ Follow multi-step instructions
- ✓ Create simple sequences in ScratchJr

### If You're Struggling
Remember:
- Everyone learns at their own pace
- Use multiple senses (see, touch, hear)
- Practice with real objects before abstracts
- Make it fun with games and stories
- Celebrate small wins

## Parent/Educator Notes

### Supporting Early Learners
- Keep sessions short (10-20 minutes)
- Use hands-on materials
- Connect to daily life
- Encourage questions
- Praise effort over results

### Common Challenges
- **Number reversals**: Normal at this age, practice with sandpaper numbers
- **Attention span**: Break into smaller chunks, use movement
- **Abstract concepts**: Always start with concrete objects

## Next Steps

**Congratulations on building your early foundations!**

Ready to continue? Move on to [Stage 1: Primary Foundations](stage-1-primary.md) where you'll build on these skills with multiplication, more complex science, and beginning programming.

Not quite ready? That's okay! Review any sections you need, and remember - strong foundations take time to build.
